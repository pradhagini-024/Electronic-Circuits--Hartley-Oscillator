## SIMULATION PROCEDURE:

1. Open the LTspice software.
2. Go to **File → New Schematic**.
3. Click the component symbol to browse and select the components.
4. Find the diode or diodes from the component list and place them.
5. Click **OK** and place the component.
6. Search for a resistor from the component menu or from the tab icons.
7. Place the resistors.
8. Search for a capacitor from the component menu or from the tab icons.
9. Place the capacitors.
10. Use **Ctrl + R** to rotate the components.
11. Use the wire symbol to connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
12. Right-click each component to assign the values.
13. Use the **Run** button to run the simulation.
14. Set the step time and click **OK**.
15. The output dialog box will open.
16. In the output dialog box, right-click and select **Add Traces**.
17. Node voltages and currents of each component will be displayed.
18. Select the required node voltages (e.g., **V(n001)**) to get the waveforms.
19. To get the voltage across a component, the trace name should include both nodes, e.g., **V(n001, n002)**.
